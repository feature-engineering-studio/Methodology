How should we deal with the strongly right skewed data?
 After discussion with professor we decided to delete all the cases with grade of zero, and cases with unreasonably extreme data 
 Then we will change our research aim to find what and how features are correlated with studentsâ€™ grades for online courses given they finished assignments.
 We have two options of methodology. We decided to compare two methodologies.
     Method 1: More traditional regression model with cross validation
     Method 2:  Classification And Regression Tree (CART) analysis or Bayesian
Next week:
Clean the data, do the deletion 
Study how to use R to produce Scatter Plots and Correlation Matrix
